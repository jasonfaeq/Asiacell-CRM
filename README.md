# Asiacell CRM Application

This Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application provides tools for managing customer data, interactions, and more.

## Overview

This app, built using Django, has its database hosted on a MySQL Server through Microsoft Azure. The inspiration for this project came from a similar app I developed in 2018 while working for Asiacell, a SIM card carrier in Iraq. Back then, the company's cloud-hosted customer database went down, and as a data-entry clerk, I took the initiative to create a quick solution. Although that initial app was a simple, rushed fix, it laid the foundation for this more advanced version, reflecting the skills and knowledge I've gained since then.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user management.
- **Customer Management**: Add, update, and view customer information.
- **Search Feature**: Search through the database to find specific customers.
- **Export**: Export the existing database into a CSV file.
